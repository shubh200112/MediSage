Every day, I have such scars on my lips. What should I do?","With what I see, I think you have a severe case of acne on your face, particularly on your lips and cheeks, which could be caused by a combination of factors such as hormonal imbalance, stress, or bacterial infection. To treat this, I would recommend using topical creams or gels containing salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide to reduce inflammation and prevent further breakouts, and also consider consulting a dermatologist for further evaluation and possible prescription medication to help clear up your skin.",,2025-06-08 15:17:50.919184
